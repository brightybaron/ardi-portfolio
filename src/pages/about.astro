        Hey, I am Ardi. I am currently a senior software engineer on the
        frontend infrastructure team at Dave. There, I focus on building dev
        tools, creating CI/CD pipelines, maintaining our component library, and
        more. I work remote from (beautiful) Denver, CO.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Imm not building tools at Dave, you can find me working on my
        private pilot license, organizing events, going to shows with my
        friends, traveling with my camera, mixing music, and skiing the
        beautiful Colorado mountains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of my full-time, I occasionally take on freelance work. If you
        are looking for someone to work with to design and/or develop your web
        app or website, feel free to drop me a line.
      </p>
      <p>
